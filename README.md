This repository is for practicing Git version control and its basic commands like creating a repository, making commits, branching, merging, and resolving merge conflicts.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the project.
- **feature-navbar branch**: A branch where a navigation bar was added to the `index.html` file.

2. **git add <file>**: Added files to the staging area.
3. **git commit -m "message"**: Made commits with descriptive messages.
4. **git branch <branch-name>**: Created a new branch to add features.
5. **git merge <branch-name>**: Merged branches and handled conflicts.
6. **git push**: Pushed local commits to the remote GitHub repository.
